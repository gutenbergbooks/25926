<h2>FOREWORD</h2>


<p><span class="dcaps"><span class="dcap">S</span></span>CHOOL days are joy days; days filled with the pleasures of
friendships and the gladness of intimacy, with the satisfaction
of work well done and the pride in having done it for one&rsquo;s
school. And we at Northrop School have been blessed with
such days from the time of four entering as kindergarteners, up through
grammar school and our subsequent joining of the League; on through
these last days when, as high school girls, we took a real part in the
activities of school life, and felt ourselves to have each one a share, however
small, in the great whole, our Alma Mater. And it is to recollection
of these joys and to the memory of our school days that we of the
senior class wish to dedicate the 1926 Tatler.</p>

<h2>CLASS HISTORY</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> SHIVER ran down my back as the last chords
of the Ivy Song were played. It was actually a
reality&mdash;our dream had come true for we were at last
garbed in those precious white robes for which we had
been striving for four years. Memories of these years
rushed over me. How burdened we were with our importance
in being Freshmen; Seniors seemed very old
and distant. Suddenly we slipped from cock robins to conscientious Sophomores. By
this time rumors were heard of a financial problem that we, as Juniors, must meet. Immediately
we began to save all our pennies in order to startle the Faculty and the
Seniors of 1925 with a luxurious Junior-Senior ball. So our Sophomore year closed
with many peeks into the class treasury.</p>

<p>Dancing, fortune telling, freaks, and so on, came to our rescue in preparation for
the J. S. We Juniors, as financiers, staged a Junior carnival&mdash;and it was successful.</p>

<p>May the twenty-ninth, in the year of our Lord, one thousand-nine hundred and
twenty-five, was the red letter day of our Junior year. Our hopes, not our fears, were
realized. Gayly we danced to &ldquo;Tea for Two&rdquo; in the green and white decked ballroom
(alias the dining room) and promenaded in a garden in Japan, otherwise the roof
garden. Sadly&mdash;ah, yes&mdash;the music hesitated and then ceased&mdash;as we unitedly sighed, perhaps with relief, perhaps with weariness.
Who knows? Our Herculean task had passed, and our eyes were turned to the magnetic red ties. Honored beyond recognition we
were the first to abide in the new Senior room, south-west parallel room 40, on the third floor. June quickly slipped near and we
fixed our hopes and ambitions on the now approaching goal, graduation.</p>

<h2>THE CLASS PROPHECY</h2>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In nineteen hundred and fifty-six<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The year of our Lord, A. D.,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sat me down, and put my specs on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An epistle of length to see.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that you may understand this better,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I&rsquo;ll herewith disclose the news of the letter:<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Dear Mike,&rdquo; the writer began, &ldquo;you know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I&rsquo;m feeling that life is far from slow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Mary B. Eaton, instructor in war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My military academy&rsquo;s not such a bore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between drills, and luncheon, and chapel, it seems<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That this life is not all that it was in my dreams.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;And Nance, instead of teaching the boys how to ride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prefers to smuggle them food, and candy beside.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the way, did you know that Virge Leffingwell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has given up art and horses as well?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She&rsquo;s opened a school, the dear old scamp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To teach all the young ladies the best ways to vamp.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The other day, as I drove in my hack,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I passed a familiar figure in black;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&rsquo;Twas irresponsible Lydia, our giggler so jolly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gone into seclusion to atone for past folly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She lives all alone, without any noise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without any jazz, and without any boys!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She told me with horror and pain in her gaze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Bee had turned actress, in movies (not plays)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that very same week was playing down town<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With R. Valentino in the &lsquo;Countess&rsquo;s Frown.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell Lydia, but I thought &rsquo;twould be great<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To go to Bee&rsquo;s movie and see how she&rsquo;d rate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I left Lyd and started, and the first thing I met,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or rather bumped into, was a fair suffragette,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Covered with signs &lsquo;E. Baker for Mayor&rsquo;.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So many there hardly was room<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see our progressive young democrat Hume!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes, &rsquo;twas none other than Marion, our businesslike girl;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She&rsquo;s adopted the slogan of &lsquo;Death to the curl!&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she&rsquo;s canvassing the city, with a terrible row,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To get votes for Ely, who&rsquo;s in politics now.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg&nbsp;15]</a></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;And Bernice and Andy, have you heard of their fate?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The last thing I know they had each found a mate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One of them&rsquo;s handsome and young, but no money,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The other one&rsquo;s rich, but crabby and funny.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But each one is happy in marriage, they say;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that&rsquo;s what really counts, say what you may.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Bernice is proud of her good-looking guy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Andy knows the old man will soon die!<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Did you see in the paper Mary Brackett&rsquo;s new fad?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Sunday School superintendent I&rsquo;ll bet she&rsquo;s not bad.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, Mike, yesterday on some errands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I encountered another of our old friends.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I&rsquo;d hired a cab because I was tired.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thought the driver was reckless and ought to be fired;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I leaned over to express my opinion, you know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if it wasn&rsquo;t our Esther, the pedestrian&rsquo;s foe!<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Did you know Marion MacDonald is engaged again?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That makes five times now, oh, woe to the men!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jean&rsquo;s spoken to her now, a couple of times,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of reforming herself, but do you think Marion minds?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jean&rsquo;s slumming committees have had lots of work,<br /></span>

<h2>FRIDAY, THE THIRTEENTH</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>E worked feverishly and hoped that there would be no
more disputes concerning the chairs. Some thought the
ones from the dining room ought to be used; others thought not.
The chairs were brought down and then taken back with much
strife along the way. Would anyone want to play bridge? We
wondered. Would anyone bring cards to play bridge with? We
wondered again. The fact that wax was being applied to the
floor caused a good deal of worry, for we were afraid we would
fall and break our necks if too much was put on. However, even
in that predicament, we were determined to be gracious and
smiling. Did everyone know that all the autumn boughs in blue
and silver were tied on with red string? We fervently hoped
they didn&rsquo;t, for we were in no condition to do anything about it
if they did. Thus our thoughts ran as we slammed down tables,
tied on table cloths, and practised our Spanish dance in uniforms
and low heeled shoes. At five-thirty we went home, thankful
that we didn&rsquo;t have to wash the windows and clean up the
furnace room.</p>

<p>Much credit must be given to those few guests who realized
that the gym was supposed to represent a cabaret. We greatly
appreciate their penetration. They perhaps didn&rsquo;t know that
fortune-telling and fishing for tin automobiles in the telephone
booth were a part of the procedure at a cabaret dance. But if
they didn&rsquo;t know these things, they had much to learn, for that&rsquo;s
what they did at our party and who were we to spurn their
filthy lucre? They also danced and ate heartily of the ice cream
and cake we served. Many thought the popcorn balls were a
holdup, but they refrained from throwing them at us when we
asked ten cents.</p>

<p>An attempt was made at amusement when we gave two
dances; one with castanets and tambourines and much swirling
and swooping; another with Spanish shawls draped on us. This
latter one was more or less of a failure, for we couldn&rsquo;t seem
to get into step when we did it a second time. The audience,
however, applauded, regardless of the fact, and didn&rsquo;t see that
the dance was any worse than it had been the first time. About
eleven-thirty it was gently hinted that the time had come for
the party to break up. We went on aching feet, hoping that
since the party had been a success financially, the guests were
not making too many derogatory remarks about it as a social
function.</p>

<p>Dawn broke, and blushed to see the sight at Northrop
School: packs of cards scattered in fifty-two different places,
tables every which way, covers off, cake and popcorn balls scattered
liberally on the floor. A few of us came to clean up, and
cleaned with many yawns. After a few hours the gym began
to take on its natural air of bleakness, and we left it to the
tender mercies of Clyde and Mullen, hoping that the Junior-Senior
would be a good one.</p>

<h3>GENERAL NEWS</h3>

<p>The other day several members of the
Sophomore class visited the studios of the
famous Mesdames Dodginsky and DeBartley,
where they were told their secret
ambitions; and by special permission we
have been allowed to print them. It appears
that Annah Margaret Thresher
would like to swim the English Channel.
Jean Crocker longs to be a Professor of
Music at Oxford, while Florence Roberts
would receive all possible degrees at Columbia.
Others seem to desire athletic
professions. Helen Dietz would like to be
the Football Coach at the &ldquo;U,&rdquo; Jane
Woodward to be the World&rsquo;s Greatest
Lightweight Forward, and Kate Velie to
be on the Olympic Sprinting Team.
Mayme Wynne has a morbid desire to be
a designer of Curious Coiffures in Paris.</p>


<h3>WEATHER REPORT</h3>

<p class="center">By E. B.</p>

<p>The Sophomores suggest a soaking
spring if the snow smelts. If it rains sufficiently
to suit Miss Svenddahl, they
forecast dancing in the Gym. The spring
days will be either cloudy, partly cloudy,
or clear. It will rain dogs and cats or hail
taxicabs, although we may have snow, a
tornado, a cyclone, a blizzard, a squall, a
typhoon, a tidal wave, or a forest fire.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>Last Friday evening the Sophomore
Select Sewing Society met at the home of
Miss Jane Bartley. A pleasant time was
had by all, making rackets and nightcaps
for the poor. Refreshments were served.</p>

<h2>GIANT TRANS-ATLANTIC AIR SHIP DOWNED</h2>

<p class="center">(Minneapolis Morning Tribune, June 21, 1932)</p>


<p>The giant airship <i>Coolidge</i> was downed last
night in a hurricane on the Atlantic. A terrific
wind arose, which broke one of the huge
wings. The ship dropped abruptly, and though
the captain fired distress signals, nothing could
possibly have saved the passengers but the
timely arrival of the <i>Admiral Sims</i>, a destroyer,
captained by Helen Tuttle, and the
ship, <i>The Roosevelt</i>, captained by Caroline
Doerr. The two crews worked feverishly, and
in less than an hour everyone was off the sinking
ship. Miss Tuttle and Miss Doerr were
the heroines of the hour, keeping their heads
and directing their crews with a coolness equal
to any man&rsquo;s. Several Minneapolis people were
on board. Among them were Miss Carol Hoidale,
famous sportswoman, who was going to
England to be in the Leicestershire horse show;
Miss Marion Wood, accomplished pianist; and
Miss Elizabeth Heegard, a well-known actress.
Miss Doerr, Miss Tuttle, and these three ladies
were classmates at Northrop Collegiate School
and graduated in 1929.</p>


<h3>FORMER NORTHROP STUDENTS CAPTURING
TITLES IN EUROPE</h3>

<p>Miss Nancy Van Slyke and Miss Mary Morison
are capturing all the tennis titles. Recently
at the tournament at Nice the two
Americans defeated Mlle. Isabelle Lenglen,
daughter of the famous Suzanne, and Mlle.
Pavol, winning both sets, 6-3, 6-0. This gives
them the world&rsquo;s doubles championship.</p>

<h3>BACK FROM MARS</h3>

<p>Miss Martha Eurich and Miss Margaret
Maroney, famous artists, returned today from
Mars, where they went to make sketches of
an improved type of building that has airplane
parking space on the roof. They were sent by
Miss Mary E. Case, president of the Animal
Rescue League, who contemplates building a
new sky-scraper for animals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Same Old Story,&rdquo; written by Miss Anne
Beckwith, is a delightful book. The plot is
very new and the book is very original. It
is pleasantly illustrated by Miss Catherine Colwell,
who is so famous for her drawings, and
is dedicated in verse by Virginia Lee Bechtol
to Miss Cordelia Lockwood.</p>

<h2>SEVENTH FORM EVENTS</h2>


<h3>SPORTS</h3>

<p>Early in the fall the sevenths and eighths had a number of
baseball games. Although the sevenths tried very hard, they
were always defeated. However, spring is coming, and they
may have better luck.</p>

<p>In midwinter when games are indoors, captain ball is the
popular sport. The two classes always play two games. In the
first one the sevenths were badly beaten, but in the second they
came close to victory with a score of 3 to 2.</p>

<p>The winter outdoor fun is on a bumpy, crooked hill back of
school used for sliding. Down it goes a continuous stream of
sleds, toboggans, and skis. Sometimes an overloaded sled drops
a passenger on the way, and sometimes a load lands upside
down in a drift, but it&rsquo;s all part of the fun.</p>


<h3>PARTIES</h3>

<p>At the beginning of school the seventh form were guests of
the eighth form at the opening League party. We danced a great
deal, and we laughed at the Wild West show and the autoride
of by-gone days. Then we climbed to the top floor for refreshments
and more laughing.</p>

<p>On the eleventh of February to return the courtesy, we invited
the eighths to a valentine party. After decorating our
guests with gay caps, we danced for a while. The event of the
day, however, was the valentine boxes. There were three fat
ones stuffed with valentines for us all. By the time we had exclaimed
over them, we were ready to have refreshments. Cheers
of appreciation ended the party.</p>


<h3>CHAPEL PROGRAMS</h3>

<p>This year we have been visited by both a princess and a
duke. The princess came from Damascus and gave us an ancient
story of her city&mdash;the story of Naaman the Leper. The duke,
who was from France, showed us pictures of beautiful old
French buildings, which he is trying to keep from being destroyed.</p>

<p>Early in March our own class took part in a chapel program
by demonstrating some lessons in musical appreciation.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>Piping merrily <em>William</em> the <em>Piper</em> floated down the meadow
<em>Brooks</em> seated at the <em>Helm</em> of his boat. Being a <em>New-man</em> in
this country he stopped to ask his way of a <em>Miller</em>. The miller
directed him across the <em>Lee</em> to a little town called <em>Goldsborough</em>.
There he stopped at the inn of the <em>Van Nest</em>. After
a good sleep, a shave with his <em>Gillette</em>, and a hearty meal of
<em>Thomson&rsquo;s</em> baked beans and <em>Wagner&rsquo;s</em> canned <em>Pease</em>, he was
much refreshed.</p>

<p>The next morning he continued his wanderings, but unwittingly
he trespassed on the land of a farmer named <em>Hineline</em>,
who threatened to take him to the village of <em>Simonton</em> and throw
him and his <em>Junk-in</em> jail. Finally he made his peace, but he had
to leave his boat behind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;However, I&rsquo;m not so unlucky,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for I have stout
<em>Douglas</em> shoes to tramp in, and my faithful dog, <em>Benjamin</em>, to
bear me company.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>COLLEGE NEWS</h2>


<p class="address">
Smith College,<br />
Northampton,<br />
Massachusetts,<br />
February 23, 1926.</p>

<p>Dear Janet:</p>

<p>When I received your letter asking me to tell Northrop what her
alumnae at Smith have been doing this year, I had a sudden sinking
sensation, since I felt that the achievements accomplished by some of
us have not been startling. However, upon digging for evidence, I
have discovered that Northrop need not feel ashamed of us after all.</p>

<p>Dorothy Wilson sings in the Junior choir, is a member of the
Smith College glee club, and of the Oriental club&mdash;one which is connected
with the Bible department&mdash;and has been chosen business manager
of the Smith College Handbook&mdash;&ldquo;Freshman Bible&rdquo;&mdash;for the class
of 1930.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pete&rdquo; McCarthy, also a Junior, who vehemently claimed that she
had nothing to tell me about herself, I discover is fire captain of her
house, a member of the French club, and chairman of the spring dance
committee.</p>

<p>On Washington&rsquo;s Birthday, at the annual rally day performance,
Mary Truesdell and Lorraine Long, dressed as sailors, with the
accompaniment of the Mandolin Club, clogged for us in multifarious
rhythms, ways, and manners&mdash;or however one does clog&mdash;to the astonishment
of all of us, who never before dreamed that professional talent
actually existed in Northampton.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Carpenter is president of her house. As for the rest of
us, Lucy Winton, Eleanor Cook, and me, all I can venture to say&mdash;and
they agree with me&mdash;is that, like the proverbial green freshman, we
have been plodding along at studies occasionally, and at all other
times we have been eating, sleeping, or amusing ourselves to the nth
degree.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to see the new <i>Tatler</i> to find out what you have been
doing this year.</p>

<p>Please give my love to everyone.</p>

<p class="sig">Very sincerely,<br />
<span class="smcap">Peg Williams</span></p>


<hr style="width: 15%;" />


<p class="address">
South Hadley,<br />
Massachusetts,<br />
February 18, 1926.</p>

<p>Dear Margaret Louise:</p>

<p>If I should attempt to tell you everything we are doing here now,
I&rsquo;m afraid that I should go far past the limits of my little column, for
our occupations are so multitudinous and varied that there is hardly an
end to them.</p>

<p>Right now, notwithstanding the ever present pursuit of the academic,
the whole college is having the most glorious time hiking over
the countryside on snowshoes, risking its dignity and perhaps its neck
in attempting the ski jump on Pageant Field, and &ldquo;hooking&rdquo; rides
with the small village boys on their bob sleds down the long hill on
College Street. South Hadley is such a tiny town, anyway, that it is
just like living in the country with lovely mountains all around.</p>

<p>By now Mount Tom and Mount Holyoke are quite like old friends,
for most of us had a personal interview with one or the other of them
when we hiked one of the ranges last fall on Mountain Day. Mountain
Day, by the way, was a red letter day, for the Freshmen particularly.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg&nbsp;34]</a></span>
It was one of those gorgeous blue October days when we could hardly
stand the thought of having to be inside, and, almost like a gift from
Heaven, Miss Woolley unexpectedly announced in morning chapel that
she would leave it to the students to vote whether they would have
their holiday then, with its incomplete arrangements, or two days
later when it was scheduled, with beautifully laid plans but with possible
showers. The girls were simply bursting with excitement by that
time, and the vote was carried unanimously. Not one class in prospect
for that day, but just a chance to start out with a lunch on your back
to &ldquo;parts unknown&rdquo;&mdash;oh, it was wonderful!</p>

<p>Another big part of our college social life here in the fall and spring
is college songs and class serenades. During September and October
we had one out by the &ldquo;College Steps&rdquo; once a week. I shall never
forget the first time we gathered under a full moon, about nine
o&rsquo;clock, and our senior song leader started us off by having us sing
all the songs we knew about the moon, with the singing of parts much
encouraged! Even if the harmony was a little doubtful in spots, taken
as a whole the result was &ldquo;perfectly heavenly&rdquo;&mdash;to one enthusiastic
Freshman. Then a few weeks later the Freshmen were called to their
windows one evening to hear &ldquo;Sisters, sisters, we sing to you,&rdquo; and
looking down, we saw the whole Junior class assembled underneath
the dormitory windows. Then in due time our turn came to &ldquo;surprise
them,&rdquo; but it wasn&rsquo;t, evidently, kept a &ldquo;deep and dark&rdquo; secret as we
had hoped, for at the end of the first song we were literally showered
with candy kisses hurled down from above.</p>

<p>These are just a few of the kinds of things we do outside our academic
work; not to mention the picnic breakfasts at &ldquo;Paradise&rdquo; in the
warm weather, sleigh rides or hikes to Old Hadley, a quaint old town
near here, Winter Carnival, or all the excitement that comes with
Junior Prom time. Then, you may be sure, the &ldquo;little sisters&rdquo; are
pressed into service!</p>

<p>What I think, however, makes Mount Holyoke mean what it does
to us is something that is almost impossible to describe, but something
that is just as real as any phase of our life here&mdash;and that is the
college atmosphere. It is created, in part, by Miss Woolley&rsquo;s wonderful
chapel services, in part by the sheer beauty of the country in which we
live, and, lastly, by the fine spirit of the girls themselves, the college
community.</p>

<p class="sig">Very sincerely,<br />
<span class="smcap">Doris Douglas</span>, &rsquo;25.</p>


<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>To the Editor of the 1926 Tatler:</p>

<p>We who once formed a goodly part of Northrop&rsquo;s illustrious student
body, but who now attend Vassar College, send our heartiest and
most affectionate greetings, to the pupils, the faculty, the trustees,
and Miss Carse!</p>

<p>In the first part of the year, when those of us who are Freshmen
were busying ourselves with getting adjusted to our new environment,
new studies, and new acquaintances, we had no time to reflect on our
past activities. But now that we have become acclimated, we take
great joy in remembering our years spent at Northrop, and realize,
more and more, all that she did for us. We owe our present life and
opportunities to Northrop&rsquo;s splendid teaching and background. The
Northrop League gave us a moral background which we shall never
lose. Our companionship with each other gave us friendships which
can never be lost, even though we may be separated.</p>

<p>Northrop Alumnae who are Sophomores and the five who are holding
up the honor of Vassar&rsquo;s class of &rsquo;26, still feel Northrop&rsquo;s influence
very strongly, and are forever singing her praises. They feel that the
training in concentration and in well-divided time received at Northrop
has proved invaluable throughout their college course.</p>

<p>The large number of us here at Vassar, set aside as &ldquo;Northrop
girls&rdquo; feel that we have a great responsibility resting on us. We have
a standard to live up to, a standard caused by the good name sent out
into the world by Northrop. May we live up to that name, may we
carry on the standard of Northrop School.</p>

<h3>THE NORTHROP LEAGUE</h3>

<p>It hardly seems necessary in this, the sixth year of the League&rsquo;s existence,
to explain its purpose. I think it is sufficient to say that the
League is an organization which, under Miss Carse&rsquo;s sympathetic guidance,
has come to control the student activities of the high school
and the seventh and the eighth grades. It is true, of course, that the
League is governed by its officers, but the League itself is what the
large body of the girls make it. The pledge, an expression of its
standards, seeks to hold each girl to a high sense of honor, loyalty, and
self-improvement. This, briefly, is the purpose. As nearer perfection
is reached, in the struggle for this goal, the League gains in power.
Thus it is that the League is the result of the effort of every member.</p>

<h2>Report of League Treasurer Given at the Parents&rsquo; and Teachers&rsquo; Dinner</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>HOULD any girl of Northrop wish to prepare herself for a position
that has to do with the handling of money, I should advise
her to begin campaigning by lobbying for the office of Treasurer
of the Northrop League. However, the reputation of the detailed work
of this office is such that there are few who are ever over-anxious to
receive it. This was my feeling at first, but now when I realize how
much I already know about making out checks, keeping accounts, and
the intricacies of banking, I feel it is all worth while. By Commencement
I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if I could fill the important position of
messenger in a bank.</p>

<p>The first thing that comes up at the beginning of each year is the
collection of the annual League dues, which are two dollars and fifty
cents. A total amount of about three hundred dollars was handed in
this year. This is put under the &ldquo;operating fund,&rdquo; and takes
care of all the League expenditures, except those of the Welfare Committee.</p>

<p>There are four departments of student activities drawing from these
League dues, athletic, entertainment, and printing and stationery. Also,
this year the League voted to back the Tatler board up with one
hundred dollars. At the first council meeting of the year a budget
is made out for the different committees of the League. This budget
is based on the expenditures of that committee for the preceding
year. Until nineteen twenty-five, the Welfare work was taken care
of by collections running through the year as the various needs arose.
This year a new system was adopted, which took care of everything
at one time. We foresaw a need of money for the Thanksgiving, Christmas,
and Community Funds, for the Near East Relief, and the French
Orphans; therefore slips were given to each girl with these different
needs listed. She was expected to put an amount after each, which
amount she pledged to pay in cash or in deferred payments. So far
eight hundred and twelve dollars of the nine hundred and two dollars
and thirteen cents pledged has been handed in. This plan is much
more systematic, and saves the trouble of conducting so many drives.</p>

<p>All money transactions of classes and committees whether receipts
or expenditures go through the hands of the League treasurer. A
system of books is maintained. Each class and committee keeps its own
accounts. Then the League treasurer has a large cash book in which
she also keeps all the receipts and disbursements of the classes and
committees. At the end of each month the balances are put in a simplified
ledger. It is from this that the monthly and annual reports are
made. When a bill is received, it is paid only by the League treasurer
after it has been <small>OK</small>&rsquo;d by the chairman of the committee responsible
for it. When money is handed in, a receipt is given to the bearer. At
the end of each month the books are balanced and checked with the
bank statement. Also the check book is verified with the bank balance.</p>

<p>Although the League treasurer is custodian of the class funds, each
class has a treasurer who keeps her own accounts. The classes have
their own dues to pay for all their expenditures. At the end of each
month, after the class treasurer has balanced her book, it is checked
over with the accounts of the League treasurer for that class to see
if they agree.</p>

<p>A checking account is kept at the Northwestern National Bank and
the savings&rsquo; account at the Farmers and Mechanics Bank. We have
had almost three hundred dollars in the savings account, but two hundred
dollars, which is last year&rsquo;s League gift to the school, has just been
withdrawn and added to the Chapel Fund.</p>

<p>The duties of a treasurer are not over until she has passed to her
successor what she has learned during her treasurership and has changed
the accounts to the new girl&rsquo;s name. After this has been done, the retiring
treasurer is released and must seek new fields in which to carry
on. In case a former Northrop League treasurer ever applies to any
of you for a position, just remember the &ldquo;big&rdquo; business in which she
began her training.</p>

<h2>NORTHROP LEAGUE WELFARE BUDGET</h2>


<p class="center">NEAR EAST RELIEF<br />
1926 FRENCH ORPHAN<br />
COMMUNITY FUND<br />
THANKSGIVING FUND<br />
CHRISTMAS FUND<br />
EMERGENCY FUND</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HIS year, when Community Fund interests brought
to our attention the need of school collections, of
which the Community Fund is but one, we thought
to have a single large drive instead of several small
drives.</p>

<p>We called in the expert opinion of one who had
long worked in social agencies, and worked out a scheme
and a budget for one drive covering all our needs. This
plan was presented to the League Council and met with
approval.</p>

<p>Sheets containing lists of the various funds for which
money was to be collected, were given to the pupils to
take home for conference with their parents. If a girl
wished to give to any one of the various funds, she was
to mark down that amount, also putting down the date
of payment (any time until February 1); or else the
money might be sent right back with the pledges. In this
way we tried to make the idea of voluntary subscription
the whole basis of our plan.</p>

<p>The total amount of the entire drive, both pledged
and paid, is $902.13, out of which $359.58 was paid in
full to the Community Fund. The total of the Thanksgiving
Fund was $166.10, out of which $106.23 was paid
for Thanksgiving baskets which were filled with good,
substantial food, and were delivered by a number of
the girls, each group accompanied by an older person,
to eighteen needy families. The Christmas fund total
reached the sum of $180.70. From this, we gave $75.00 as
gifts to the house-staff. The Emergency Fund amounted
to $151.25. From this, we gave $36.00 to help support a
French orphan for whose care we are responsible.</p>

<p>There is also an unapportioned fund. A number of
pledges were returned with only the total amount
marked down, none of which was divided among the funds.
These amounts were put down under the unapportioned
fund. From this sum, we drew $30.00 for the Near East
Relief. In addition to all this, we are having a continuous
drive for old clothes which we place where most needed.</p>

<p>After the various distributions were made, we found that our book balanced with that of the League treasurer.</p>

<p>Handling a situation of this sort has been an interesting task, and I think that we all have greatly profited
by the experience, and believe that it has been a preparation for future service to the Community.</p>

<h2>The Junior-Senior Dance, 1925</h2>


<p><span class="dcapo"><span class="dcap">O</span></span>N Friday morning,
May 29, 1925, each Junior awoke with the entire responsibility
of the Junior-Senior dance on her shoulders. Ten o&rsquo;clock found some of the
class in an effort to carry out the green and white color scheme, robbing
the neighbors&rsquo; bridal wreath hedges of all their glory. Returning to
school they wound the blossoming sprays in and out of a white lattice
work, which a few of their industrious class mates had made to cover
the radiators in the dining room. They then hung green and white
balloons in clusters from the side lights. While this was being done,
others were converting nice-looking automobiles into furniture vans.
The furniture was arranged on the roof garden, over which Japanese
lanterns were hung.</p>

<p>Having finished these tasks, we had by no means completed our
work. The supper tables next occupied our attention. These we arranged
in the side hall. Centering each was a miniature white May
pole wound with green and white streamers. The appearance was festive
indeed.</p>

<p>After the lapse of a few hours the weary Juniors returned to welcome
their guests, the Seniors.... As the clock struck twelve, the
music ceased, the building resumed its former tranquility, and the
happy guests filed home.</p>

<h2>We Entertain Summit School</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">E</span>VERY year Northrop and Summit schools come together at one
place or the other for an informal party. This year, it being our
pleasure to entertain the Summit girls, we looked forward to the
occasion as one of our most enjoyable events.</p>

<p>We departed from the usual form of entertainment in presenting
the French play &ldquo;Le Voyage de Monsieur Perrichon.&rdquo; Although
probably not every one in the audience understood all the speeches, the
play went off well, for the plot is such that it is easily comprehended
through the acting; also to aid the audience a short synopsis was read
in English before the curtain rose, by Shirley Woodward, who looked
the part of a dashing French soldier.</p>

<p>The roles of that amusing pair, Monsieur and Madam Perrichon,
were taken by Betty Long and Barbara Bailey. Henriette, their daughter,
was portrayed by Anne Healy, and the two charming lovers, Daniel
and Armand, by Dorothy Sweet and Janet Morrison.</p>

<p>An additional feature of the program was provided by the faculty
sextet, in the form of several pleasing songs. After the play, the faculties
of both schools had refreshments upstairs, and dancing followed
in the gymnasium.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">L</span>E huit mars nous f&ucirc;mes tr&egrave;s heureuses d&rsquo;avoir avec nous le Duc de
Tr&eacute;vise. Comme Mlle. Carse &eacute;tait dans l&rsquo;est, Mlle. Bagier le pr&eacute;senta.
Il fit une conf&eacute;rence des plus int&eacute;ressantes sur la reconstruction
de l&rsquo;ancienne architecture de la France, accompagn&eacute;e de projections
charmantes de son sujet. Il expliqua de son ravissant accent fran&ccedil;ais, les
d&eacute;g&acirc;ts qu&rsquo;on fait aux beaux &eacute;difices du moyen &acirc;ge. Il nous soumit le projet
de son organisation pour conserver divers anciens ch&acirc;teaux, aux villages
diff&eacute;rents de la France pour chaque ville am&eacute;ricaine qui aura appropri&eacute;
de l&rsquo;argent pour cette cause, donnant ainsi le moyen aux citoyens de
chaque ville d&rsquo;avoir un logis quand ils visiteront le village ou la ville dans
lesquels leur ch&acirc;teau particulier se trouve. L&rsquo;argent qu&rsquo;on a d&eacute;j&agrave; donn&eacute; a
fait beaucoup pour avancer le travail de la reconstruction. Nous f&ucirc;mes
charm&eacute;es de d&eacute;couvrir que, quand il retombait dans sa langue natale, nous
p&ucirc;mes avec peu de difficult&eacute; le comprendre. Apr&egrave;s que la derni&egrave;re projection
eut &eacute;t&eacute; montr&eacute;e, le Duc voulut beaucoup une photographie des
&eacute;l&egrave;ves de Northrop School. En cons&eacute;quence nous nous assembl&acirc;mes au
c&ocirc;t&eacute; sud de l&rsquo;&eacute;cole o&ugrave; Mlle. Bagier fit deux photographies des jeunes filles
avec leur ami nouveau-trouv&eacute;. Comme cela fut une grande occasion pour
les plus jeunes filles, elles d&eacute;mand&egrave;rent &agrave; grands cris des autographes que
le Duc leur donna avec bont&eacute;. Ensuite on nous rappela &agrave; nos le&ccedil;ons qui
nous sembl&egrave;rent plus tristes que d&rsquo;ordinaire par contraste avec l&rsquo;heure
tr&egrave;s interessante que nous venions de passer avec le Duc.</p>

<h2>The Princess Rahme Haider</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T would seem that the good angels were plotting in favor of Northrop
School, for this year we have had one delightful entertainment after
another. Foremost among these events was a visit from the Syrian
princess Rahme Haider and her charming companion Miss Burgess, who
gave us a fascinating dramatic reading from the Bible. The entire school
was held spellbound by the art of the princess, who made a very artistic
appearance in her Oriental garb and had a charming personality. Princess
Rahme Haider most assuredly gave us one of the most interesting and
profitable programs of the year.</p>

<h2>HOCKEY</h2>


<p><span class="dcapt"><span class="dcap">T</span></span>HIS year a new regulation in regard
to hockey practise was introduced.
The girls were required
to report twice a week instead of
once, one of these days being given
to stick practise.</p>

<p>The first game of the season was
played on November ninth between
the Seniors and the Sophomores. It
was a very close one resulting in a
one to one tie. On the next day,
November tenth, the Juniors beat
the Freshmen by a score of five to
nothing. The game on November
second resulted in another tie; this
time a scoreless one between the Seniors and the Freshmen, which was
most unsatisfactory to both teams. On November sixteenth the Senior-Junior
game was played which the Juniors won six to nothing. On the
eighteenth the Sophomores won from the Freshmen eight to nothing,
and on the next day the game between the Juniors and the Sophomores
was played. As no one had crossed the Juniors&rsquo; goal since the beginning
of the &rsquo;24 season there was a great deal of interest in the game. It was
an exceedingly hard contest, two girls being more or less knocked out
during the game, but the Sophomores won by a score of three to
nothing.</p>

<p>We were fortunate this season in having the weather remain so
that we were able to play all the games on the schedule.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2>The Riding Contest</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE annual riding contest was held on the Parade Grounds, Friday,
October 16, Mlle. Bagier and Betty Fowler acting as managers.
Although it was a cold and wintry day, a large crowd
turned out. Dr. E. W. Berg, Mr. L. McFall, and Mr. William Hindle
were the judges, and the Misses Anderson acted as ring mistresses.
Everything went off very smoothly, beginning with the Junior Cup
Class, followed by the Senior Cup Class, the Pony Class, and ending
with Five Gaited Class. After the contest, tea was served in the
gymnasium, where the awards were given out. The Junior Cup went to
Ruth Clark; the Pony Cup, to Virginia Leffingwell; the Five Gaited
Cup to Betty Fowler; and the much desired Senior Cup to Mary
Louise Sudduth.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2>Base Ball and Captain Ball</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>N the fall the Sevenths and Eighths had several baseball games.
They were very exciting in spite of the fact that the Eighths
always won by a generous margin. However the Sevenths took
the defeats so well that no one could call them &ldquo;poor losers.&rdquo; After
the snow came, captain ball began. The two match games were very
interesting. The score of the first was 10-2 in the Eighths&rsquo; favor, and
of the second was 8-7, the same side being victorious. Then came the
Gold and White games, both of which the Whites won. It was hard,
but it was fun, to play against a girl that one had previously played
with as a partner. These games brought out such good sportsmanship
that we all enjoyed them.</p>

<h2>BASKETBALL</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE basketball season opened with much enthusiasm as soon as
school began after the Christmas vacation. The attendance at
practices was especially good this year, and the members of every
class reported regularly. In order to arouse some spirit, each class
distributed its colors among its rooters, and there was much competition
between the classes in finding original yells. As a result of these efforts
the crowds at the games were exceptionally good, much larger
than in previous years. The Sophomore-Junior game, the first of the
season, was won by the Juniors after a hard fight. The next two games
were the Sophomore-Freshman and the Senior-Sophomore, which were
both won by the Sophomores. The Juniors then played the Freshmen
and were victorious. The Senior-Freshman game, one of the most exciting
of the season, ended in a tie, much to the disappointment of
both sides. The Seniors in their last game at Northrop played the
Juniors and won. As a result of these games, the Juniors and Sophomores
were competitors in the tournament.</p>

<p>The girls worked hard to make the gymnasium look suitable for
the occasion and were rewarded for their efforts, for cheering and
enthusiastic crowds filled the gym. The best yelling of the evening,
however, was done by the Sophomores, who nearly raised the roof with
their snappy and well-led cheers. Their serious and well performed
stunt of forming and singing, contrasted with the ridiculous showing
of the Juniors made on tricycles. After the stunts, the game began
and certainly proved to be a close one. Although the Juniors were behind
during a good part of the game, they finally won by a score
of 11-8. The tournament closed the inter-class games and those of the
Gold and White teams began.</p>

<p>In order that more girls might take part in the games, the upper
school had been divided into two large teams called the Gold and White.
These teams were in turn subdivided into basketball teams, and many
games were played between these teams. Although the audiences were
not all that might be desired the plan can be called a success since it
interested more girls in the game. The White team won the first two
games and the Gold the next two; therefore the final game between
the two &ldquo;A&rdquo; teams would decide whether the Gold or the White team
would win the basketball series. The game was won by the Gold team,
11-8. This game ended the basketball season, which has been an unusually
good one.</p>

<h2>Gardens I Have Read About</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>OOKS are the means by which one may travel without moving. It
is through the medium of a book that I was able to visit a garden
in Italy. It happened to be a garden that was typically Italian and
a very charming one. The entrance was through a vine-covered Tuscan
arch at the side of a villa, and down several steps to a wide terrace.
The sun was beating down outside, but inside this walled garden all
was cool and refreshing. At one&rsquo;s feet were clumps of darkest green
ferns, like miniature forests. At the bottom of the terrace there was
a terracotta pool, where water flowers were drifting on their flat green
pads. Around the edge of this pool and through an aisle of tiny
fragrant pink rose bushes was a space enclosed on three sides by
feathery greens. Here a laughing satyr was perched on the top of
a fountain, spouting water in a silvery arc. Through a shaded avenue
could be seen other secluded spots with marble benches in front of
other fountains. In another direction was a grotto where water trickled
down gray, moss-covered stones. Far in the distance were cypress trees
waving their spear-like tops and standing guard over the coolness and
beauty of the garden.</p>

<p>Very different from this is the sunny English garden that next I
visited. It, too, was terraced and had fountains, but the water in these
fountains sparkled in the sun, and the cool dampness of the Italian
garden was lacking. On the terrace were occasional closely-trimmed
yew trees, or box trees clipped in odd shapes. A curving walk, edged
with laurel, led to the ivy-walled inner garden. Here, in the full sun
and warmth, grew, not the delicate rose bush of my Italian garden,
but sturdy, bold rose trees, and apple trees, above snowdrops, daffodils,
and crocuses in round, oblong, and square beds. These had trimmed
herbaceous borders, and gray flag walks lay between them. Beyond
towered great elms, but even these did not shut out any of the sun,
which reached the foxgloves and violets, transplanted from the moor
to the corner of the wall.</p>

<p>Here in America, though I have never been East, I know I should
feel at home in a New England garden. My entire knowledge of them
has been gained from books, but I am sure, from what I have read
that these gardens are quite as charming as the more formal ones of
other lands. Separated from the street by either a white picket fence
or a row of lilac bushes, grow in their seasons nasturtiums, pinks,
larkspur, mignonette, sweet peas, and forget-me-nots, in neat rows. All
these are in such profusion that one sees only the glorious general effect
and fails to notice that the garden has been planted with total disregard
to the blending of colors. At the back, against the fence, tall
sun flowers flaunt themselves, while in front are clumps of gorgeous
peonies, and at the side beds of fragrant mint.</p>

<p>All these gardens I think of when spring comes, and my yearly
gardening fever seizes me. But at the end of two months, when my
radishes go to seed before attaining edible size, and those of my
flowers that are not choked by weeds have been dug up by other
members of the family, I go back to the dream gardens in my books.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg&nbsp;49]</a></span></p>

<h2>DIXIE</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>N old man, ragged, but with an air of dignity, quickly glanced at
his stop watch as a small figure, crouched over a shining black
neck, shot by. With a thunder of hoofs the black horse whirled
past and fought for her head down the stretch. She would win the
following Saturday&mdash;she must! If she didn&rsquo;t then she too would have
to go and leave the ruined old gentleman, who looked so feeble leaning
over the white rail which enclosed the mile track. After much coaxing
the black colt came mincing up to her old master.</p>

<p>The small colored boy, as black as his mount, was bubbling over with
enthusiasm. &ldquo;Dat dehby, Suh, is going to be won by ma Dixie,&rdquo; patting
the curved neck of the horse.</p>

<p>The old gentleman looked up. &ldquo;Mah boy, you must remembah that
Dixie will have otheah good hawses to beat. Vixen is the favohite and
very fast, although Ah know mah little black friend heah will do heh
best to honah the purple and white,&rdquo; glancing proudly at the headband
of the black marvel. &ldquo;Next Satahday will decide it all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A shadow fell across the colt. Looking up, the gentleman, known
as Colonel Fairfax, saw a man dressed in a checkered suit and orange
socks. On a tie to match was a monstrous, well polished diamond,
which sparkled wickedly in the sun. The man stood staring at the
stop-watch. &ldquo;Ah beg yoh pahdon, Suh, but theh anything Ah could
do foah you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man, hearing the question, looked up, flushing. &ldquo;Youh horse is
a Derby entry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Colonel Fairfax eyed the horse reflectively and answered, &ldquo;It all
depends on her condition, and only time can answeh that.&rdquo; The man
hurried away, leaving the old gentleman looking after him, a deep
frown on his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Washington, Ah am a bit doubtful about this new-uh-acquaintance,&rdquo;
he addressed the exercise boy.</p>

<p>Each day, no matter how early Dixie was given her exercise, the
stranger was to be seen loitering in the distance or walking briskly
beside the track&mdash;seemingly deep in thought. His presence seemed to
trouble the Colonel, who watched his colt anxiously.</p>

<p>At last, the final workout. Colonel Fairfax and the unwelcome
stranger leaned over the rail, intently watching the black horse, which
appeared to have wings. The stranger, who had been seen talking to
the owner of Vixen, the favorite, annoyed the old gentleman; he was
suspicious of this flashily dressed man and did not conceal his feelings.</p>

<p>Sundown, Friday, found the stable at Churchill Downs buzzing with
excitement. The favorite&rsquo;s stall was surrounded by interested old
racing men, who loved the thoroughbred and his sport, while a few individuals
in gaily checkered suits crowded about, listening to the many
&ldquo;hunches&rdquo; for business reasons only. An old man sat before Stall No. 7.
Glancing up, he noticed two men peering in at Dixie. One was the man
who had seemed so much interested in the mare&rsquo;s trial gallops. Through
the half-open door of the box stall could be seen a horse in faded
purple and white blankets. After a hurried conversation the two men
passed on to the favorite&rsquo;s stall, where they smiled at the jockey,
looked in, and walked on.</p>

<p>Long after the one-thirty special night train had whistled at the
Downs crossing, a dark figure could be seen sliding along the stall
doors&mdash;&ldquo;Ten&mdash;Nine&mdash;; Eight&mdash;&rdquo; Then it came to halt before Stall No. 7,
and slipped through the door. It felt in the dark for the blanketed
horse&rsquo;s neck. The horse jumped as a dagger-like needle was thrust into
its neck. The colored boy, in a drugged sleep at the door of the stall,
stirred in his dreams, but was still again. The door opened quietly,
and the figure slipped out, leaving the horse in No. 7 leaning drunkenly
against the side wall. A shaft of moonlight fell across the intruder&rsquo;s
face, revealing the same man who had attended all of Dixie&rsquo;s trial gallops.
Little did this unscrupulous person realize that the black mare
was spending the night in an old deserted barn near the race track,
guarded by an old gentleman whose mouth was twisted into a whimsical
smile, while a &ldquo;guaranteed-to-be-gentle&rdquo; livery horse was leading a life
of luxury that evening in Stall No. 7, Churchill Downs.</p>

<p>Derby day at Churchill Downs! Kentucky was doing homage to the
thoroughbred. As the band played &ldquo;Dixie,&rdquo; the Derby entries filed
through the paddock onto the field. Proudly leading the string of the
country&rsquo;s best two year olds, was the song&rsquo;s namesake, a true daughter
of the South. With arching neck and prancing feet, Dixie, the pride of
an old man&rsquo;s heart, took her place at the barrier. Her jockey looked
up as he passed an aristocratic old gentleman, dressed in a faded coat
which reminded one of &ldquo;befoah de Wah&rdquo; days and whose hat remained
off while the horses passed.</p>

<p>The barrier was up, and the roar shook the grandstand. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
off!!&rdquo; The favorite, Vixen, shot ahead and seemed to be making a
runaway race. Cheer after cheer rent the air. An old man clasped
his program a little tighter and breathed a prayer. Around the turn
came Vixen, but not alone. Crouched to the ground, a small black
horse crept up to the flying tail of the favorite. Down the stretch
the two thundered, fighting for supremacy. &ldquo;Foah Kentucky, Dixie,
and the honah of the purple and white!&rdquo; As if she heard this plea
from her master, Dixie bent lower. Then, her black nose thrust ahead,
more than a length in advance of Vixen, she flashed under the wire,
bringing &ldquo;honah&rdquo; to the purple and white.</p>

<h2>MY BUREAU DRAWERS</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>Y bureau drawers,&mdash;I wonder what their contents could tell!
Whenever I go through them with the firm resolve to clear out
everything that I do not actually use, I always end by saving
some things just for the sake of the memories connected with them.</p>

<p>Take that pink satin hair ribbon, for instance. I wore it for the
first time with a new pink dress at a party in California. It brings
back all the thought of California as I first saw it in nineteen twenty,
memories of stately and haughty poinsettias, of date palms from which
one could pick and eat fresh dates, of a dancing ocean with its myriads
of lovely sea creatures, and its gaily-colored beach equipment, of an
amusement park with the roller coaster on which I nearly had heart
failure.</p>

<p>Then, in another corner, lies a string of green beads. What could
better recall to my mind the night of my graduation from the grade
school? The recollection makes me want to be in grade school once
more. I well remember how one of my classmates forgot to bring the
music to the class song which was to have been one of the attractions
of the program. Disaster marked that evening farther when a tall Danish
boy, looking the picture of selfconsciousness and misery, arose to
give the farewell address. As nearly as I can remember, it ran thus:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, on the evening of our graduation ve vish
to tank de teachers and also de principal for de vork&rdquo;&mdash;a long awkward
pause&mdash;&ldquo;ve vish to tank de teachers and also de principal for de
vork&rdquo;&mdash;a still longer pause, interspersed with rising giggles from the
graduating class&mdash;&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, ve vish to tank de teachers
and also de principal for de vork vich they have done in getting us
trough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, there at the back of the drawer, is a black satin sash. It
brings to my mind an entirely different kind of memory. It is one
thing that I have left from the dress I wore at my grandfather&rsquo;s funeral.
I remember all the tragedy of the occasion, lightened by one spot
of comedy, my grandmother&rsquo;s losing her petticoat.</p>

<p>I dare say that some day I shall throw away these things that others
consider rubbish, but I shall never part with the memories for which
they stand.</p>

<h2>A SURPRISE</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T was early in the morning when Nancy Nelson awoke. She got up
and put on her wrapper and one slipper, as she couldn&rsquo;t get the
other one on, though she tried hard. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;there must
be something in my slipper.&rdquo; So Nancy felt in her slipper and then
pulled out her hand. Why, there was a little package! &ldquo;Who put it in
there, I wonder,&rdquo; she said, quite surprised. Nancy asked everybody in
the house. Then her mother said, &ldquo;Nancy, did you forget that it is
your birthday?&rdquo; Then she opened the little package and found a small
silver thimble, with the name &ldquo;Nancy Nelson&rdquo; on it.</p>

<h2>THE DEPARTURE AND THE RETURN OF THE SHIP</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T was a clear, warm day in late spring and a ship was leaving the
harbor, its departure accompanied by a merry clanking of chains
as the anchor was drawn up. The lusty cheers of the sailors floated
back in echoes. The shore was crowded with the wives and sweethearts
of these two hundred sailors, their brightly colored gowns and fluttering
handkerchiefs making a lovely picture against the background of the
green cliffs. On board the men were singing lustily as they performed
their tasks and the last echo of their happiness floated back clearly to
the little group on the shore as the ship dropped below the hill and out
of sight. The women had already settled down to their period of
watchful waiting and were trusting the safety of their loved ones to
God, who had always protected them and brought them home safely
before.</p>

<p>It was a clear, crisp night in late October and the moon was sending
its silvery beams out over the quiet waters. Everything was pervaded
by an air of mystery. Slowly, from far out at sea, a great ship
came slinking into the harbor. As it drew nearer, it glowed with crimson
lights. Then, suddenly every light went out and again the great mysterious
hulk was swallowed up in the darkness. Not a sound was heard.
Could this be the same ship that had sailed away so gayly three years
ago? No one awaited its coming, for it had been long given up for lost.
It came nearer and nearer, and a breeze, which had suddenly come up,
whistled through its thin sails and moved the spars, making a sound
like the rattling of dry bones. Then, as if in response to the command
of a ghostly captain, the great, black hulk sank into the darkness under
the water, leaving only a whirlpool to mark its existence. It sank as
it had sailed in; slowly and mysteriously.</p>

<h2>TROUBLES OF AN AMATEUR</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>ARY had been assured that &ldquo;Dolly&rdquo; was absolutely dependable,
would not shy, had a kind and gentle disposition, and was easy
to manage; but now she was actually gazing upon this amiable
annihilator, the courage oozed out of her suddenly pounding heart and
her eyes widened with fright and suspicion. She wished now she hadn&rsquo;t
been so desirous of tempting fate on such a seemingly ferocious and
unnatural brute.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dolly,&rdquo; on the other hand, happily unaware of his savageness and
unnatural spirit, drooped his homely, ungainly head in a dejected manner.
To him, Mary was only one more burden, one more wriggling,
gasping infliction, to be jogged slowly about for her first ride. He
snorted in disdain. Mary jumped. Why didn&rsquo;t she use her own feet?
&ldquo;Dolly&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t want to be bothered. Finally he rolled an eye back to
survey his passenger.</p>

<p>The groom was gradually coaxing Mary on&mdash;onto something terrible.
She just knew it! &ldquo;Dolly&rdquo; seemed to assume supernatural proportions
as Mary reached out a hand to grasp the reins which were
handed to her. Someone boosted her on. Goodness! She was going
right over on the other side! But no! She found herself sitting up
on the broad back of &ldquo;Dolly&rdquo;; it was a very precarious position. How
did one keep one&rsquo;s balance? She just knew she couldn&rsquo;t stay on. There
was nothing to hang onto, and her....</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help!&rdquo; she shrieked, as her steed casually stamped a clumsy foot,
in the endeavor to rid himself of a persistent fly.</p>

<p>The groom, now mounted, led her horse out into the ring. Mary
hoped he&rsquo;d hang onto the reins. If he didn&rsquo;t.... Mary pictured
herself a mangled, shapeless mass. She shuddered. She&rsquo;d seen those
movie actors dart gaily about and had thought it would be lovely to
learn to dart. But now&mdash;she wondered if they had been tied on!</p>

<p>Oh! they were jogging. Mary didn&rsquo;t seem to understand the nature
of the jog. She was out of breath. Grasping the pommel, she looked
miserably at the long neck swaying in front of her. Two long ears
fascinated her. Up and down, up and down. Ah! why didn&rsquo;t he stop?
She attempted to shriek, but only succeeded in emitting faint gasps
as &ldquo;Dolly&rdquo; swerved to avoid a small hole. Inside she seemed to be
jolted to pieces. Her heart shook her chest, and a giddy feeling overpowered
her. Her vision blurred, and her breath came in short gasps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dolly&rdquo; had now slowed down to a walk, but to Mary this was the
wildest of gaits. Every minute she fully expected to die on the spot.
She couldn&rsquo;t stand it another second. She couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;she couldn&rsquo;t!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time is up, Miss,&rdquo; announced a cheery voice. &ldquo;Do you wish to
dismount?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary came up from the depths of agony, and hope lit her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh-h-h!&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;Yes, I&mdash;Yes! Yes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was lifted, or rather dragged, off, she didn&rsquo;t know which, didn&rsquo;t
care as long as she was off. The ground seemed to come up to meet
her. Why didn&rsquo;t things stand still? Even the unsuspicious &ldquo;Dolly&rdquo;
appeared to be performing grotesque antics. Mary took a step, just
one. It was not necessary for her to take more to realize that she
was very stiff. &ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; She slowly gathered up her coat and hat,
and limped painfully out of the Academy. Now she could realize that
an amateur, in riding anyway, had her troubles in walking!</p>

<h2>BOOKS I SHOULD LIKE TO WRITE</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T is last period on a long, sleepy, particularly humdrum day at
school. Shirley sits trying to concentrate on a history text-book,
but her mind will wander, despite her really noble efforts to
distinguish the Valerian Laws from the Licinian Laws.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What an idiotic law to have to make!&rdquo; she mutters resentfully.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m sure I shouldn&rsquo;t be so dumb in History if I had an interesting
text-book. It seems as though someone could write it, even if we
aren&rsquo;t all Van Loons and H. G. Wellses. I bet I could myself&mdash;at least
I&rsquo;d make it a fascinating book if not a strictly exact one (&lsquo;Yes you
would,&rsquo; says her Subconscious, but she pays no attention)! When I
think of the generations of defenseless students to be subjected to
these text-books, my heart aches for them!... The Valerian Law
was....&rdquo;</p>

<p>The scene changes from this lethargic one to a fireside on a winter
evening. She drops the book in her lap, the yells of the savages are
fainter. She shakes the salt spray from her chair and tries to adjust
herself once more to the prosaic of a land-lubber.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To write a book like that is my only desire on earth,&rdquo; she murmurs,
as she reaches for a volume of Jane Austen.</p>

<p>Now, completely involved in the career of <i>Emma</i>, she says, &ldquo;Oh, for
that gift of the gods Jane Austen had! Her speech&mdash;a rippling stream
of perfect and delicious English, the King&rsquo;s English indeed! Each
phrase is as delicately constructed as a watch, and all her watches tick
together as one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus the incorrigible child goes on, unaware how many fascinating
books she has longed to have written. From <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i> to
<i>Thunder on the Left</i>, from <i>Walter H. Page</i> to the <i>Constant Nymph</i>,
and from <i>Chaucer</i> to <i>Edna St. Vincent Millay</i>! A veritable gourmande,
she is.</p>

<p>But forgive her. Who has not felt that he might improve a text-book?
Who has not longed, in reading a glorious book, for similar
brilliance? What lover of books is unmoved to an occasional effort at
emulation, even if he afterwards destroy it? You who do these things,
sympathize with Shirley, who, by her own hand we do confess, is bitterly
disillusioned every time she tries to write a theme.</p>

<h2>OUR STREET</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HREE Indians padded softly along through the tall dark pines.
Their errand seemed peaceful, since their number was so small
and they came so openly. Soon the path widened out, and finally
led to a small glade in which stood a rough cabin. The Indians stopped
to observe cautiously before making themselves known. What they
saw filled them with curiosity and awe, for standing before the cabin
was a white man praying, his deep voice echoing through the wild
stillness of the forest. Beside him stood a younger man, whose attention,
while respectful, was not undivided, for he had spied the Indians
and waited restlessly for the &ldquo;father&rdquo; to finish his devotions. These
done, he called his superior&rsquo;s attention to the savages lurking on the
outskirts of the glade and beckoned to them to come forward. Both
white men were eager to learn what the Indians might tell them, and
the elder, who spoke the Indian tongue, talked glibly with the redskins.
They, in turn, were curious about several things. First, the strange
contrivance that hung from Father Hennepin&rsquo;s belt. He explained that
it was to help him find his way through the uncharted country. Save
for the compass he would quickly be lost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hugh,&rdquo; grunted one of the braves, &ldquo;that no good. I lead you,&rdquo;
surprising the Jesuit by his use of English.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; answered the priest. The two white men went into the
cabin, gathered their scanty baggage, and reappeared at the door.
By this time the other Indians had disappeared down the path by
which they had come. In the opposite direction, without a backward
glance, the party of three men, the Jesuit, his companion, and the Indian
guide, set out to find new thoroughfares.</p>

<p>Now from morning to night traffic rolls along the same trail. The
narrow path that once found its way through the forest with many
turnings and twistings is now a wide, paved avenue. Over it go street
cars carrying busy people, trucks laden with gravel or coal, the ever-present
automobiles of people bent on pleasure. The street is lined
on either side with tall buildings: stores, offices, houses, churches,
museums. As we go down the avenue, we come to what was once a
clearing in the forest. Instead of the simple cabin, there are now a
variety of buildings: a small store whose owner, a French Canadian,
carries on a thriving business; opposite, a restaurant owned by two
yellow Chinese, who specialize in chow-mein; next door, the establishment
of a husky Yankee, who plies his trade by greasing automobiles
and supplying gasoline to motorists demanding that necessity.</p>

<p>A thriving community now, what will this one time forest clearing
be two hundred years hence?</p>

<h2>A CONVERSATION AT THE DINNER TABLE</h2>


<p>At dinner Daddy told us he had seen a prince. I asked him what
prince it was.</p>

<p>Then Mother said, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you read the paper, Ella Sturgis?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was the Prince of Greece,&rdquo; said Daddy, &ldquo;and he wore a monocle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chucky said, &ldquo;What is a monocle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a glass people wear in one eye and squint a little to keep
it in,&rdquo; said Mother.</p>

<p>Then she asked Daddy where he had seen the prince.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the club,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I was invited to have lunch with him,
but I could not accept the invitation because I had promised Ella
Sturgis to do something for her dog, and Ashes is more important than
the Prince.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>LORING PARK IN GRANDFATHER&rsquo;S DAY</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N about 1855 Mr. W. H. Grimshaw came to live in Minneapolis
where the Plaza Hotel now stands. Then Loring Park and the
vicinity was farm land, and an Indian named Keg-o-ma-go-shieg had
his wigwam at the corner of Oak Grove and Fifteenth streets. Mr.
Grimshaw learned from him that Indians had lived on this spot for
generations, but that since the land had come under government control,
most of the Indians had gone. Keg-o-ma-go-shieg, because he loved
so much the spot where he was born, returned every summer to fish
in the lakes and hunt in the woods of his beloved birthplace. There
is no tablet or monument to this last Indian in Loring Park, but there
is one to Ole Bull facing Harmon Place. Would it not be more fitting
to have a statue of Sitting Bull?</p>

<p>Also there used to be an old, well-traveled Indian trail through the
Park, of which there is no trace now, although some people have
searched carefully for it. According to Mr. Grimshaw there used to
be countless passenger pigeons, which in the migratory season roosted
in the trees of Loring Park. At noon the sky would be darkened by
a cloud of these birds, the air would be filled with the sound of their
wings, and they would alight on the branches of the trees, nearly
breaking them down by their great weight.</p>

<p>Then there was the old brook that flowed out of Loring Park lake,
across Harmon Place, under the present automobile buildings, and
emptied into Basset&rsquo;s Creek. The old military road from Minnehaha
Falls to Fort Ridgley ran through this section, roughly along Hennepin
Avenue.</p>

<p>West of Hennepin Avenue was Ruber&rsquo;s pasture, where cows and
horses used to graze, and where the Parade Grounds, the Armory, the
Cathedral, and Northrop School now are. Mr. J. S. Johnson was the
first white settler in this part of Minneapolis. In 1856 he bought one
hundred and sixty acres, of which a part is now Loring Park, for one
dollar and twenty-five cents per acre.</p>

<h2>&ldquo;AT THE BACK OF THE NORTH WIND&rdquo;</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>F you would enjoy a glance at the home of one of the winds, read
<i>At the Back of the North Wind</i>, by George MacDonald. Young
Diamond, a little boy, the North Wind, Diamond&rsquo;s father and
mother, and Old Diamond, which is a great and good horse,&mdash;these are
the characters you will hear the most about in this story. The story
narrates a series of adventures, in dream form, of Young Diamond and
an uncanny creature who calls herself the North Wind. An unusual
part of the story is the trip to the sea where the North Wind will
destroy a ship. Diamond does not want to perceive this, so North Wind
drops him in a great cathedral, where he wakes to see the moon-lit
windows showing the saints in beautiful garments. If you like fairy
tales, I would suggest that you read this incredible book.</p>

<p>My dear friend:</p>

<p>I do so hope you will like the book <i>Dandelion Cottage</i>. It is an
interesting story of four little girls named Betty Tucker, Jeanie Mapes,
Mabel Bennett, and Marjorie Vale, who pay rent for a cottage by
pulling dandelions. They have such interesting adventures and act so
business-like that you ought to love it. I did when I read it. Carroll
Watson Rankin certainly knows what girls like, for she has innumerable
objects in that cottage that I know you would love to have in your
room. It is very clean in the cottage, with not an atom of dirt anywhere.
The part I like best in the story is where Laura Milligan, a
disdainful little girl, moves into the neighborhood. She makes life miserable
for the cottagers. When you read the story, be sure you look very
carefully for the things Laura does, for they are very interesting. I
know you prefer to read the book yourselves, so I will close now.</p>

<p class="sig">Sincerely yours,<br />

<h2>KRAG AND JOHNNY BEAR</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">Y</span>OU would be very much interested in the story of <i>Krag and
Johnny Bear</i>, by Ernest Thomson Seton. The names are very
cute. There are Nubbins, his mother, White Nose, and his mother.
This part of the story tells about Krag, an extraordinary little sheep,
who has many fascinating adventures. Little White Nose is very lazy,
obstinate, and wary. Every morning Nubbins gets up and tries to wake
up White Nose. When Krag grows up, he has beautiful big horns,
and the hunters try to catch him so they can mount them. At the end
of the story he is caught and his horns are mounted and kept in the
king&rsquo;s palace. I know you would like to read this book if you are fond
of animal stories. Another interesting story is about Randy, an extraordinary
sparrow who is brought up with some canaries and learns to
sing. One day the cage Randy was in fell over with an astounding
crash and he escaped. He built a nest of sticks, which was the only
kind he knew, and was very disconsolate when his mate, who was an
ordinary sparrow, threw them away and brought hay and straw instead.
Randy&rsquo;s mate is finally killed and Randy is caught and put back in
his cage. I think you will like this book if you like animal stories.</p>

<h2>USES OF PUMPKINS</h2>

pumpkin. &ldquo;I wonder what Thanksgiving is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Long ago,&rdquo; began a big pumpkin, &ldquo;when the first white people
came to this country, it was in early winter, and these settlers could
raise no food. Many of them died of hunger and cold. But the next
year the settlers planted many crops, and they grew wonderfully. So
they had a day to thank God for the crops they had. The day they
celebrated is called Thanksgiving.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; said the little pumpkin. &ldquo;I am sure Teddy was thankful
he had such a nice big pumpkin to make his Jack o&rsquo; lantern out of on
Hallowe&rsquo;en.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think the cattle are thankful that they have us to eat in winter,&rdquo;
said a middle-sized pumpkin, trying very hard to look wise, but the
November air was so delightfully chilly and crisp he had to laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Farmer Brown and his family are thankful to have such
a nice pumpkin pie every Thanksgiving,&rdquo; said a big pumpkin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never knew pumpkins were so useful,&rdquo; sighed the little pumpkin
sleepily. Then he turned over and went to sleep.</p>

<p>Millions of boys and girls of today are eager partisans of the Cadillac&mdash;anxious
to grow up and have a Cadillac of their own, like Father and Mother.</p>

<p>With thousands, the ownership of a Cadillac is a family tradition dating back
to the days when Grandfather bought his first Cadillac, a quarter of a century ago.</p>

<p>All through these 25 years Cadillac has consistently stood in the forefront of
all the world&rsquo;s motor cars.</p>

<p>Eleven years ago Cadillac produced the first eight-cylinder engine&mdash;the basic
foundation of Cadillac success in marketing more than 200,000 eight-cylinder Cadillac
cars.</p>

<p>Today the new 90-degree, eight-cylinder Cadillac is the ultra modern version of
the motor car. Its luxury, comfort, performance and value reach heights of perfection
beyond anything ever attained.</p>

<p>Thus once again Cadillac strikes out far in advance, renewing its traditional
right to this title, The Standard of the World.</p>
